# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

###Description
During peak COVID situations,i have worked on a project named COVID-19 Wordometer. The ultimate aim that i have while making this project was to test my abilities and also to create a web app that is highly easy to use and have great understand ability.I noticed that in order to access the COVID situation people were using traditional google searches which was really difficult to understand. Moreover, they rely on textual data which seems really boring to look at. Understanding these issues i came up with an idea to create a project that has a graphical user interface and people will find it attractive to use. data graphs make it more relatable.I have used technologies like React JS for the front-end part and use Node JS to access NPM and use packages like Map box and Line graph to make it graphically more interactive.My role was of a main developer along with my friend who worked as an assistant developer.A user can select any required country from the drop-down and may get to know all significant COVID details. He may also select options like active cases recovered and deaths in that particular region. Also live maps will be shown to that user showing him the COVID distribution pattern in that region.
